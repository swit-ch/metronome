Hi, just playing around here with the original code by Chris Wilson.

I won't be interested in divisions of 8th, 16th notes, if at all there should be many other tuplets. 

But many different time signatures would be nice, (therefor also) greater range of BPMs ...

Here follows the original text of the forked metronome:

# Web Audio Metronome

This application shows how to use a collaboration between a setTimeout scheduler and the Web Audio scheduler to properly implement rock-solid timing for audio applications.

Check it out, feel free to submit issues or requests, fork, submit pull requests, etc.

The live app is at http://webaudiodemos.appspot.com/metronome/index.html.
