# metronome
Trying to understand git, GitHub and web technologies, playing around.

## Sooner or later maybe
* selectable subdivisions of time signatures
* choose new meter at next beat or next bar (ATM on bar, but tempo on beat)
* storage and presets (ATM last state per session saved)
* sequences of stored states
* tuplets per bar (currently the beat is the "quant")
* tuplets per beat?
* pendulum animation per beat is almost useless with fast tempi, use subdivisions then
* sonic variation
* widgets
	* input type number bad on iOS
	* bigger thumb for input type range
* behind the scenes
	* modularity
	* testing
	* documentation
	* cleaner code
