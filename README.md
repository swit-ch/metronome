# metronome
Trying to understand git, GitHub and web technologies, playing around.

## Sooner or later maybe
* tuning tone
* pages, tabs for other settings
* selectable subdivisions of time signatures 
* pendulum animation per beat is almost useless with fast tempi, use subdivisions then 
* widgets
	* input type number bad for numeric input (min) (have passive numeric output element plus + - triggers?)
	* sliders iOS bad too (selection, where to preventDefault() ?)
	* <del>bigger thumb for input type range might help</del>
* choose new meter at next beat or next bar (ATM on bar, but tempo on beat)
* storage and presets (ATM last state per session saved)
* sequences of stored states
* Better than below: SC convertRhythm (Mikael Laurson RTM-notation)
	* tuplets per beat, bar?
* sonic variation
* behind the scenes
	* modularity
	* testing
	* documentation
	* cleaner code
