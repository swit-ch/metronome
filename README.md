Hi, just playing around with a fork of original code by Chris Wilson (thanks!).  
https://github.com/cwilso/metronome

Trying to understand git, GitHub and web technologies, almost private. 

Metronome:  
Probably I won't be interested in divisions of 8th, 16th notes, if at all there should be other tuplets too. 
Different time signatures would be useful to me, greater range of BPMs ...

Here follows the original readme text of the forked metronome:

# Web Audio Metronome

This application shows how to use a collaboration between a setTimeout scheduler and the Web Audio scheduler to properly implement rock-solid timing for audio applications.

Check it out, feel free to submit issues or requests, fork, submit pull requests, etc.

The live app is at http://webaudiodemos.appspot.com/metronome/index.html.
