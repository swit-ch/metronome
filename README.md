#Metronome
Trying to understand git, GitHub and web technologies, almost privately here. 
Playing around.

I won't be interested in divisions of 8th, 16th notes, if at all there should be other tuplets too. 
But time signatures are useful to me (no subdivisions yet), greater range of BPMs ...

Current state -- probably BUGGY ! --
